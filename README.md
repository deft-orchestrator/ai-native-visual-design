# 🎨 AI-Native Visual Design Library

**AI-Native Visual Design Library** is a revolutionary framework that uses a **Holonic Multi-Agent System** with an **Entity-Component-System (ECS)** architecture to generate high-quality visual designs automatically or semi-automatically.

## 🎯 Vision

> "The first AI-native creative operating system that enables AI agents to collaborate economically in generating professional-quality visual designs."

## 🏗️ Core Architecture

This library is built on a three-layer architecture:

1.  **Intelligence Layer (Holonic Multi-Agent System)**: Specialized agents for tasks like color, typography, and layout, coordinated by strategy agents using economic protocols.
2.  **Data Layer (Entity-Component-System)**: A high-performance data backbone that represents design elements as entities and their properties as components. This allows for efficient processing and manipulation at scale.
3.  **Output Layer (Multi-Format Generators)**: Capable of rendering designs into various formats, including web (HTML, SVG, React), print (PDF, EPS), and motion (MP4, Lottie).
